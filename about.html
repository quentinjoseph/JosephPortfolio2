	<p> I really dislike talking about myself so instead of creating something new I'm going to quote a quick bio of me that I wrote a long time ago.  So I guess I'm just quoting myself.  That's a thing right?</p>
	<blockquote>Michigan native Quentin Joseph began playing drums in church as a young boy. After displaying a strong passion for music he began studies with a private instructor at age 10. This grew as he gained foundational experience playing with numerous school bands, and by age 16, Quentin was gigging with local groups in the area. In 2001, he was invited to play in the house band at musical hot-spot Pickford Live in Tokyo. He then spent several years traveling and recording with live hip-hop band –Funktelligence. While in California, the group was seen by Arrested Development’s front man, Speech, and invited to back him on his Japan tour in 2003. After traveling and touring Quentin returned to complete a Bachelor of Music in Jazz Studies at the University of Michigan. There he had the opportunity to study and perform with great musicians and teachers such as Ellen Rowe, Robert Hurst, and Geri Allen. After graduating in 2008, Quentin found a place in Mayer Hawthorne’s band, the County, and for the past few years has been a strong creative and rhythmic force in the band. Mayer Hawthorne and the County has traveled throughout North America, Europe, Japan, Australia, many parts of South America, and continue to tour internationally.</blockquote>
